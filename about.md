This site is a collection of some projects i did on my spare time.
The theme used for this jekyll site is [Balzac](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll).

You can see my profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clement-lefevre-5616a886/)

One thing i know : I will never understand text encoding in python.
