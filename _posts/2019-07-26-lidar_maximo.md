## Playing with Lidar data

After having stumbled upon this nice vizualisation from Fabien Lezeau @LzuFabien :

i followed this excellent tutorial from [Daniel Huffman @pinakographos](https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/2017/11/16/creating-shaded-relief-in-blender/)

On top of that i retrieved the [2018 Lidar data from Berlin](https://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb/) (look for "ATKIS® DOM - Digitales Oberflächenmodell")

Finally, and before my desk began to burn with the CPU overheat, i found a way to run Blender on Google Colab.
This is really nice, (and free), as you can simply upload your raster files and blender on google drive and run the rendering from your browser with a Tesla K80 GPU. What required 5 hours on my old laptop takes 6 minutes, which i considere an improvement.

Just open the picture in a new tab to zoom :
