I had the chance to take part to the [Berlin Technologie Foundation Seminar](https://www.citylab-berlin.org/events/summerschool/) and realize a small project within a team.

Using data scrapped by the Berlin Technologiestiftung, we implemented a dashboard to visualize the flows of shared bike accross berlin. The result can be seen [here](https://clementlefevre.shinyapps.io/shiny_deckgl/)
