Learning by doing, well, this is a summary of my own self-teaching experience (in the chronological order) in the field of data science. Hoping it can help.


### [Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
Like lots of people, it was my first ML course.

- Pros : good overview of ML principles, you implement yourself the different algorithms.
- Cons : assignments in Matlab, Decision Trees are not covered.
- Workload : 6 hours/week for 2-3 months.

### [CS109 courses from Harvard](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/videos.html).

It's a kind of 360Â° view of Data science : stats, programming, infrastructure (AWS E2C), data visualization (Tableau).

- Pros : Blizstein (for the Stats part) is really cool to watch, an interesting focus on the "Story telling" aspect,  assignements as Jupiter Notebooks.
- Cons : N/A.
- Workload : 8-12 hours/week for 5 months.

### [The Analytical Edge](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-3)
The course i should have started with.
A very gentle  introduction to data analysis. The theoritical part is light, and the focus is on practical cases, a lot of. 
- Pros : perfect to learn R, tons of exercices with various datasets.
- Cons : the R code does not use (as of 2016 version) the tidyverse librairies. Thus i strongly recommend the SWIRL tutorial on [dplyr and tidyr](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses/tree/master/Getting_and_Cleaning_Data.) before starting the course.
- Workload : 8 hours/week for 1 month.

### [Stats in R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics)
Brilliant introduction/refresh on inference statistics, frequentists/baysesian stats and linear model. 
- Pros : excellent material to grab the concepts of the confidence intervals, p-values, features selections. It also really helped me to get used to RStudio.
- Cons : the new Bayesian part (as of March 2017) is quite hard to follow, i switched to [Bayesian Methods for hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers)
- Workload : 10 hours /week for 3 months.

### [Udacity Machine Learning engineer](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd009/syllabus)
A kind of recap of the ML concepts, with 6 Jupiter notebooks projects to complete.
As of today i'm still on it, and find it an interesting low-cost substitute for anyone who did not make to MIT nor wrote a PhD thesis in the field.


### Readings

- [Seth Davidowitz - Everybody Lies](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062390851/everybody-lies)
Written in an anecdotical way (remember story telling ?), a funny introduction to data science by an economist who did work at Google and produce nices articles in the NYT. Try the [google correlate](https://www.google.com/trends/correlate) then.

- [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/books.html) : cool introduction to ML with well commented Jupiter Notebooks.

- [PyData conferences](https://www.youtube.com/user/PyDataTV) : i went to PyData Berlin 2016, and will attend the 2017 session. I really enjoyed the exotics talks like measuring the neutrinos from an Antartic stations, but in my opinion, too much talks were focused on the "Spark Big data cloud" trinity.
